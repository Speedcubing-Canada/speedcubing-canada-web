# Commands that should be run to set up a new Compute Engine VM.
# First, switch to root.  You'll need to set up a root password, use the one
# from the Tech Secrets doc ("Compute Engine VMs").
#
# sudo passwd
# su
#
# (in general, if you're using the VM, you'll likely want to be root).
#
# Next, clone the Speedcubing-Canada repository:
#
# cd /
# apt install git
# git clone https://github.com/Speedcubing-Canada/speedcubing-canada-web speedcubing-canada
#
# Then cd into the Speedcubing-Canada directory in the back folder and run this script (without sudo).
# Finally, run backend/load_db/startup.sh to download the WCA database and
# initialize the datastore.  The first run can take a few hours; subsequent runs are
# faster since they only need to load entities that have changed.
#
# These commands can also be used to get a local development server working.
